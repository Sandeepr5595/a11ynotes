    <h1>WCAG Conformance Testing, Detailed Methodology</h1>
    <P>Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive
        technologies.</P>
    <h2>4. Robust</h2>
    <h3>4.1.1.Parsing</h3>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>Long gone are the days when WCAG required markup to be 100% free of syntax validation errors, but WCAG 2.0 still
        requires the code to pass a subset of applicable validation rules to ensure browsers and assistive technologies
        can render the content reliably, without posing potential accessibility barriers for users. This subset is
        limited to four general rules, which include making sure Web documents are nested according to specification,
        elements do not contain duplicate attributes, ID attribute values are unique on any given page and opening and
        closing tags are used according to specification. The general intent of this requirement also includes
        specifying a document type declaration (doctype) to facilitate document validation, using HTML elements in
        accordance with specifications so their intended semantics are exposed to browsers and assistive technology,
        avoiding features not defined in HTML and XHTML to prevent unexpected accessibility barriers and refraining from
        using deprecated HTML tags and attributes.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong>Further information is available at the W3C, in the <a target="_blank"
            href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-parses.html">"Understanding SC 4.1.1"<img
            src="..\Images\new-window.png" alt="opens in a new window" class="new_window" width="13"
            height="13"/></a> document.</p>
    <h4>Who Benefits</h4>
    <p>Users of assistive technologies and keyboard-only users are the ones who benefit the most from this requirement.
        As examples, duplicate id values might cause content from being operated or navigated correctly, and failure to
        properly close HTML tags may prevent assistive technology from reliably conveying the nature of the markup to
        users, thereby making it difficult for them to comprehend or even navigate through content. The overall goal is
        to ensure a robust behavior across browsers and assistive technologies.</p>
    <h4>Reminders</h4>
    <p>Keep the following in mind when providing accessible solutions for this success criterion.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Complete Start and End Tags:</strong>Elements MUST have complete start and end tags.</li>
        <li><strong>Nested According to Specification:</strong>Elements MUST be nested according to their
            specifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Duplicate Attributes:</strong>Elements MUST NOT contain duplicate attributes.</li>
        <li><strong>Unique IDs:</strong>Element IDs MUST be unique.</li>
    </ol>
